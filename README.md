Rack with Sprockets
===================

Simple template set up to run sprockets within a basic one page rack application. I use this for messing around with coffeescript / sass outside of the rails context. 

To use: 

* Clone the repo
* cd into the directory
* rackup

Then just whack html files into /public and any sass/coffee files into /assets.
